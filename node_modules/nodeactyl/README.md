## Installation
```
npm install nodeactyl
```

## What am I?

Nodeactyl is a Library for node.js to communicated with the Pterodactyl Panel,you can control *any* server on your nodes with it (If you purchase a server from another host, no worry! The API works with your own server too!). This library's originally was to be used in Discord bots, however it can be used in ny node.js project.

## How do I work?
This library works by querying the Pterodactyl API (REST requests) using a library called [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).

## Documentation
https://docs.nodeactyl.xyz

## Disclaimer
We (The Nodeactyl team) are not responsible for any damages that you cause to your servers/nodes by using this API. 

Remember: This API can potentially be dangerous with the ability to Delete Servers/Nodes at an instant is extremely easy! 

It is *not* our fault if your API key is revealed to the public. When asking for help please do **not** send the full stack error. This will reveal your ENTIRE Host/Application API key in the request, if someone asks you to show them the error it should only be trusted sources! (Such as the Pterodactyl Team/Nodeactyl Team). You should also have your API key changed every 1-3 days to prevent issues like this.
